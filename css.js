The font-variant Property 

The CSS font-variant property allows you to convert your font to all small caps. The values can be set as normal, small-caps, and inherit. 

Not every font supports CSS font-variant, so be sure to test before you publish.



The vertical-align Property

Vertical align property does not act the same way for all elements.
For example, some additional CSS styling is needed for div elements.

The HTML: <div class="main">
   <div class="paragraph">
   This text is aligned to the middle
   </div>
</div>
The CSS:
.main {
    height: 150px; width: 400px;
    background-color: LightSkyBlue;
    display: inline-table;
}
.paragraph {
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: middle;
}

Result:
display: inline-table; and display: table-cell; styling rules are applied to make the vertical-align property work with divs.




The word-spacing Property

The word-spacing property specifies the space between words in a text. Just like the letter-spacing property, you can set the word-spacing values as normal, length, and inherit.

When a weird spacing is used, and it is necessary to keep the selected paragraph with normal word spacing, the normal option is usually used.

To define an extra space between words, you can use positive measurement values like px, pt, pc, cm, mm, inches, em, and ex.
Negative values are also permitted. Here is an example to show the difference.






The CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model represents the design and layout of the site. It consists of margins, borders, paddings, and the actual content.

The properties work in the same order: top, right, bottom, and left. 

The term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

More on Box Models

Every element of the webpage is a box.

CSS uses the box model to determine how big the boxes are and how to place them.
The box model is also used to calculate the actual width and height of the HTML elements.



The border Property

The CSS border property allows you to customize the borders of HTML elements.
In order to add a border to the element, you need to specify the size, style, and color of the border.
The example below shows how to add a solid green border to the paragraph.

Border Width

The properties for the border can be set separately. The border-width property specifies the width of the border.

p.first {
   padding: 10px;
   border-style: solid;
   border-width: 2px;
   border-color: blue;
}
p.second {
   padding: 10px;    
   border-style: solid;
   border-width: 2px;
   border-color: #FF6600;
} 
p.third {
   padding: 10px;    
   border-style: solid;
   border-width: 2px;
   border-color: rgb(0, 153, 0);
} 

The border-style Property

The default value of border-style is none, which defines no border.
There are various styles supported for the border-style property: dotted, dashed, double, etc. The example below illustrates the differences between them.

In CSS, it is possible to specify different borders for different sides, using the following properties: border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, and border-left-style for the corresponding sides.

The background-image Property

The background-image property sets one or several background images in an element. Let's set a background-image for the <body> element.

The url specifies the path to the image file. Both relative and absolute paths are supported.

By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and is repeated both vertically and horizontally to cover the entire element.

The background-image Property

Background-image can be set not only for the whole page, but for individual elements, as well.
Below we set a background image for the <p> element.


To specify more than one image, just separate the URLs with commas.








The CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model represents the design and layout of the site. It consists of margins, borders, paddings, and the actual content.

The properties work in the same order: top, right, bottom, and left.

The image below illustrates the box model:







More on Box Models

Every element of the webpage is a box.

CSS uses the box model to determine how big the boxes are and how to place them.
The box model is also used to calculate the actual width and height of the HTML elements.

Total Width of an Element

When working with boxes, it is important to understand how the total width of an element is calculated.
For example, the total width of the box with paddings will be the sum of width plus padding left and padding right.


Here is another box with margins, border, and paddings.
The total width is the sum of left and right margins, left and right borders, left and right paddings, and the actual width of the content.

When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you set the width and height of the content area.
When setting a background-color to a box, it covers the content area, as well as the padding.

Total Height of an Element

The total height of an element is calculated the same way as the width.
The example below is the same box from the previous lesson with padding, border and margin.

To summarize, Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin





The Table Properties

The look of an HTML table can be greatly improved with CSS.

The border-collapse property specifies whether the table borders are collapsed into a single border or separated as default. If the borders are separate, the border-spacing property can be used to change the spacing.

The caption-side Property

The caption-side property specifies the position of a table caption. The values can be set as top or bottom.
In the example below, we specify the placement of a table caption to top.

The empty-cells Property

The empty-cells property specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table.
Possible values are:
show: the borders of an empty cell are rendered
hide: the borders of an empty cell are not drawn

Here is the empty-cells property that is used to hide borders of empty cells in the <table> element.









Setting Styles to Links

Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).
In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in. The following pseudo selectors are available:
a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links
a:visited - defines the style for visited links
a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it
a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
- a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
- a:active MUST come after a:hover

Links' Text Decoration

By default, text links are underlined by the browser.
One of the most common uses of CSS with links is to remove the underline. In the example below, the text-decoration property is used to remove the underline.

The following properties are used to control the look and feel of links:
border:none - removes border from images with links
outline:none - removes the dotted border on clicked lines in IE







The cursor Property Values

There are numerous other possible values for the cursor property, such as:
default - default cursor
crosshair - cursor displays as crosshair
pointer - cursor displays hand icon
The list of possible values is quite long. 

Setting the Mouse Cursor Style

CSS allows you to set your desired cursor style when you mouse over an element. For example, you can change your cursor into a hand icon, help icon, and much more, rather than using the default pointer.







display:none

display:none hides an element, so it does not take up any space. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there.

There are plenty of other display values, such as list-item, table, table-cell, table-column, grid, etc. Just play with values to see the difference. 






The visibility Property

The visibility property specifies whether an element is visible or hidden. The most common values are visible and hidden.

Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to "none" or the visibility property to "hidden". However, notice that these two methods produce different results:
visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but it will still affect the layout:








Positioning Elements

The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big.

Elements can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the positioning method.

Static Positioning
HTML elements are positioned static by default. A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

p.position_static {
   position:static;
   top: 30px;
   right: 5px;
   color: red;
}

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.



Relative Positioning

A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
The properties top, right, bottom, and left can be used to specify how the rendered box will be shifted.


The content of relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements, but the reserved space for the element is still preserved in the normal flow.
This value cannot be used for table cells, columns, column groups, rows, row groups, or captions.
Absolute Positioning
An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is <html>.

Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned element does not exist.
Absolutely positioned elements can overlap other elements.








Floating

With CSS float, an element can be pushed to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.
Float is often used with images, but it is also useful when working with layouts.
The values for the float property are left, right, and none.
Left and right float elements in those directions, respectively. none (the default) ensures that the element will not float.
Below is an example of an image that is floated to the right.

Elements are floated horizontally, meaning that an element can only be floated left or right, not up or down.







Clearing the Float

Elements that come after the floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property.
The clear property specifies the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

In the example below, if we set the float property to the div, only the paragraph that comes after the div will be wrapped around the image.


Using clear

Use the values right, left, and both to specify the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

The default value is none, which allows floating elements on both sides.

Clearing Floats

both is used to clear floats coming from either direction.

The HTML:This paragraph is above the div element 
and is not affected by the float right property. 
<br/><br/>
<div class="floating">
   <img src="css_logo.png" />
</div>
This paragraph comes after the div element 
and is affected by the float right property. 
<br/><br class="clearing"/>
This paragraph is out of the floating group 
and is not affected by the float right property.
<br/> <br/>
The CSS:
.floating {
   float: right;
}
.clearing {    
   clear: both;
}










The overflow Property

As discussed earlier, every element on the page is a box. If the height of the box is not set, the height of that box will grow as large as necessary to accommodate the content.


The CSS overflow property specifies the behavior that occurs when an element's content overflows the element's box.







The overflow Property

As discussed earlier, every element on the page is a box. If the height of the box is not set, the height of that box will grow as large as necessary to accommodate the content.

The CSS overflow property specifies the behavior that occurs when an element's content overflows the element's box.

The overflow Property Values

There are four values for the overflow property: visible (the default value), scroll, hidden, and auto.

The value scroll results in clipped overflow, but a scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may be seen.

auto and hidden

auto - If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to make it possible to see the rest of the content.
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.

The default value for the overflow property is visible.
